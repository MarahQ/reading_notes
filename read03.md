# An introduction to wireframing
## 1. What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?
**Wireframing** is a practice used by *UX designers* which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.
When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. 
Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
## Examples of wireframes
That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

## What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process
As we mentioned above, different*UX designers* approach the task of wireframing in different ways. 
Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online. But more often than not, the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires.
It depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed.
