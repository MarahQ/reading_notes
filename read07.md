# JavaScript Function
### JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
### Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
You will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.
### The () Operator Invokes the Function
Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.
Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
