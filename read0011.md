**Summary**
LAYOUT
X <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
X The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
X Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
X Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
X You can include multiple CSS files in one page

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages.
For example, an e-commerce site
tends to show product photos
at the same size. Or, if your site
is designed on a grid, then you
might have a selection of image
sizes that are commonly used on
all pages, such as:
Small portrait: 220 x 360
Small landscape: 330 x 210
Feature photo: 620 x 400
Whenever you use consistently
sized images across a site,
you can use CSS to control
the dimensions of the
images, instead of putting the
dimensions in the HTML.
