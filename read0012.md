Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

**Setting up**
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in.

The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options listed in the documentation.

**Basic usage of canvas**

Let's start this tutorial by looking at the <canvas> HTML element itself. At the end of this page, you will know how to set up a canvas 2D context and have drawn a first example in your browser.
