# Growth-mindset

## way to the moon

the **growth mindset** is a way of thinking and living or more likely to be an attitude with the whole life
**growth mindset** and openmind doesn't mean to be without character or letting anything affects you but about letting your self to evolve and stay updated
on the opposite side we will find the **Fixed mindset** this mindset see that success are only for those who have shiny and already known talents or only super highly intellegent people, thats restrict people from trying learning takeing risks and discover new things and discovieres and will always supprt the most tradditional states

## Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset

1. Challenges : chalenges for the growing mindset like a new trophy to win but for fixed mindset a supression to take or lower the abilites
2. Obstacles : when fixed mindset faces obstacles they lose focus and miss their target while in growing mindset obstacles will increase the persistant and patient on the target they had set for themselvs.
3. Effort : growth mindset believes in the qoute No pain No gain while fixed mindset sees making more effort smae as making less effort
4. Criticism : fixed mindset will hear critisesm as failled trials to take them down while growth mindset will see it as chance to grow more and get ride of there weak points
5. Success of others: last but not least growth mindset will see others success inspiring but fixed mindset will consider it threatining.
