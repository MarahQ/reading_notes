# Operators and loops
In For statment 
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A do...while statement looks as follows:

do
  statement
while (condition);
Copy to Clipboard
statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.)

If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while.

Example
In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and reiterates until i is no longer less than 5.

let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1;
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 5);

while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement
Copy to Clipboard
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.

Example 1
The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
Copy to Clipboard
With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
Example 2
Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes false—otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:

// Infinite loops are bad!
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}

labeled statement
A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:

label :
   statement
Copy to Clipboard
The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any statement.
break statement
Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.
When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.
Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed in the following
The return value matches the expression to the right of the = sign in the “Meaning” column of the table above. That means that (x = y) returns y, (x += y) returns the resulting sum x + y, (x **= y) returns the resulting power x ** y, and so on.
In the case of logical assignments, (x &&= y), (x ||= y), and (x ??= y), the return value is that of the logical operation without the assignment, so x && y, x || y, and x ?? y, respectively.
Note that the return values are always based on the operands’ values before the operation.
When chaining these expressions, each assignment is evaluated right-to-left. Consider these examples:
w = z = x = y is equivalent to w = (z = (x = y)) or x = y; z = y; w = y
z += x *= y is equivalent to z += (x *= y) or tmp = x * y; x *= y; z += tmp (except without the tmp).
