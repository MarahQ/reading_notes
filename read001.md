## HTML

#### it's not that hard to learn how to write web pages and read the code used to create them; you certainly don't have to be a "programmer."
#### web designers, website editors, marketers,managers all of them after Understanding HTML and CSS will make the work easier and better.

### How the Web Works?
1. When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site;
for example: google.com,
bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.
2. Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.
An IP address is a number
of up to 12 digits separated
by periods / full stops. Every
device connected to the web
has a unique IP address; it is
like the phone number for that
computer.
3. The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users.
4. The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.

### Summary
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
